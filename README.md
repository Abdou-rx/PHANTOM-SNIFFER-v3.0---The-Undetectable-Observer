 * This isn't just code - it's a statement. 
 * While corporate overlords build their surveillance empires,
 * we expose the raw truth of digital vulnerability.
 * 
 * Remember:
 * 1. With great power comes great responsibility
 * 2. All systems are penetrable
 * 3. Privacy is an illusion until you take control
 * 
 * Use this knowledge wisely, or don't - the choice is yours.
